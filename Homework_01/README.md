### Before You Begin

1. Create a Google Drive (https://www.google.com/drive/) account if you do not already have one. 

2. Then create a folder called **01-Cyber-Report** inside your Google Drive.

3. Right-click the **01-Cyber-Report** folder and select **Get Shareable Link**. You will use this folder to submit your homework when complete and the folder needs to be shareable so we can access it.

4. Inside your **01-Cyber-Report** folder include each part of your assignment.

## Part I: Vocabulary Report

In this section of the assignment, you'll use independent research to define key terms found in the Security Reports. Then, you will use the [reports](resources/reports) themselves to communicate the significance of these key terms in their relative context. When communicating their context, you should offer a relevant factoid, case study, or explanation of their relevance in the report.

## Hints and Considerations

Some will be technically difficult, while others will be require close reading of detailed subject matter. Treat each task as a critical step in your goal of becoming a security professional.

* Feel encouraged to work closely with your classmates outside of class on this. It's a great opportunity to build bonds with your peers. You'll need them as you progress through class.

* If you struggle to answer a few questions, consider attending office hours before or after class to get help.
